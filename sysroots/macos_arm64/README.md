# How to add macOS SDK?

Distributing the MacOSX.sdk directly is not recommended. 
It's part of Apple's proprietary development tools and distributing 
it could violate their licensing terms.

For testing cross-platform builds, developers may provide their own macOS development kit (SDK).

To set up the SDK for macOS:
1. Install Xcode: Download and install the latest version of Xcode from the Apple App Store.
2. Open a Terminal: Launch the Terminal application.
3. Run the following commands:

<code>cd &#96;xcrun -show-sdk-path&#96;/..</code>
<br />
<code>
    tar cf - MacOSX.sdk | xz -4e > ~/MacOSX.sdk.tar.xz
</code>
<br />

4. Copy `MacOSX.sdk.tar.xz` to the computer with current project. 
Let's imagine that you copy or download SDK to `~/Downloads` directory and the project path is 
`~/Projects/llvm_mini_toolchain`. 
5. Extract MacOSX.sdk to the project directory `sysroots/macos_arm64` directory with help of next command:

`tar xf ~/Downloads/MacOSX.sdk.tar.xz -C ~/Projects/llvm_mini_toolchain/sysroots/macos_arm64/`

That's it, you project is ready for cross-platform builds where target is macOS ARM64.
